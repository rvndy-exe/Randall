    <p style="text-align: justify;">The media has immense influence over people, at times indirectly dictating what they should or<br>
should not do in their life. From newspapers, libraries, and word of the mouth we can receive information.<br>
However, predominantly with just a touch of a mobile screen, we can access everything and with this,<br>
consequently comes censorship. Generally, censorship occurs in a variety of ways; Books, films, music,<br>
the press, radio, television, and the entirety of the internet for many claimed reasons such as national<br>
security and individual protection. However, with suspicion fueled by skepticism of this, I decided to<br>
research this topic.  The ethical dilemma in question here is regarding the moral principle of the general<br>
media suppressing the masses that use their programs. To explore if it is ethical for the media to censor<br>
information, we will discuss the two perspectives in this dilemma, the media, and the audience/users.<br>
The first perspective will aim to investigate the media giants and their standpoint on why censoring<br>
is a necessity for their user regulations. The second perspective will follow the audience/users and <br>
their opinions on why censoring is immoral, supporting individual standards in place of society.<br>
All of this is in significance to finding a solution that puts both sides at ease.<br>
