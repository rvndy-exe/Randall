	<p>
		Hi, my name is Randy, I’m a graduating senior at Bronx Early College Academy . I’ve taken classes in basic HTML and Python in my sophomore
		year in high school. Along with Watching videos as well as referencing some websites for self-tutoring, I’ve grown to
		acknowledge myself as a learner and I take pride in my growth. I’m fascinated by the idea of creating things in the
		line tech especially videogames. I visualize a lot and I want those things to come to fruition
