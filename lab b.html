    <p style="text-align:center;">This piece I attempted to imitate, I dub it the purp trees. The hues of purple combined <br> with the calm stability of orange and red provide a sense of tranquil and grandeur.<br> There’s rhythm and motion that flows within each layer.
 I was very determined to<br>finish it. Although it was instructed to be finished by a due date, I was very ambitious<br>to see the finished work.
Using six different layers, I was able to put the foreground<br>and background of the image to contextualize the landscape as a whole. Blending in<br> colors was a challenge, especially with a mouse and keyboard as tools for art. My<br> precision was not the very best to do a perfect copy,at times tracing pixel<br>by pixel became somewhat tedious but the results were worth every second.
