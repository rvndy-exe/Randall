	<p>	Hi, my name is Randy, I’m a graduating senior at BECA. I’ve taken classes in basic HTML in 7th grade and Python in my sophomoreyear in high school. Along with Watching videos as well as referencing some websites for self-tutoring, I’ve grown to acknowledge myself as a learner and I take pride in my growth. I’m fascinated by the idea of creating things in the
	line tech especially videogames. I visualize a lot and I want those things to come to fruition</p>
