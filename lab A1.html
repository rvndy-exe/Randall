<!-- Extend the Madlib so that it has at least 8 different words-->
<p style="text-align:center;"> Here's a madlib about a kid named <span id = "test1"></span>  who had an imaginary friend <span id = "name2"> ____</span>. One day the two<br>of them went up a hill and found a pot of <span id = "noun1"> _____ </span>. As they got closer and closer, a <span id="noun2">_____</span> jumped at<br>them and put up his <span id="hands">_____</span> up. He put a beating on to the both of them. The next day the two <br>showed up with <span id="name3">_____</span> and he bit of the laupracaun's ear. The laupracaun said to mike,"I <br>jutht don't underthtand all thith madneth". Mike was angry for the jokes <br> the lauprachaun made about <span id="speech">_____</span> speech so he hit him with a right hook and he was <span id="gone">_____</span></p>
